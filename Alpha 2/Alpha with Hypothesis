Hypothesis:

The stocks with an enterprise value to EBIT ratio (EV/EBIT) low are undervalued and can outperform in the future. By further ranking these
stocks based on the exponential of the negative mean of a combined metric involving cash to operating cash flow (liquidity of companies) and
the current ratio (ability of companies to clear its short term debt with current assests) over a short period, and then neutralizing it's effect
with respect to recievables, cashflow, open/close and earnings/ capital expenditure (to manage risk and balance the portfolio), it is proposed that these stocks will yield better performance.
