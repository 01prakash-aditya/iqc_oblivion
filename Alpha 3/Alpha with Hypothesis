Alpha:

trade_when(rank(volume)>=0.5 ,tanh(ts_rank(snt_social_value/rel_num_cust,60))+0.51*rank((vwap-close)/close)-returns,-1)

Hypothesis:

Stocks with higher-than-average trading volumes, where the social sentiment is significantly positive or negative
(as smoothed by the tanh function) and where the VWAP is notably different from the closing price, tend to exhibit
specific return patterns. This relationship can be exploited to generate trading signals by accounting for the combination of these factors.
