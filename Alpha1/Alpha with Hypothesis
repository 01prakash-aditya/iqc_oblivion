Alpha:

alpha=group_scale(sales/revenue,market*1.25);
beta=quantile(ts_rank(pretax_income-income_tax-mdl175_qots, 240));
alpha>0.5?vector_neut(beta*4,receivable):beta;

Hypothesis:

When the sales-to-revenue ratio is sufficiently high, the resultant financial metric
(net income after tax) will exhibit a more pronounced effect, potentially leading to higher financial 
stability or performance. Conversely, if the sales-to-revenue ratio does not exceed the threshold, the 
financial metric will remain unadjusted, indicating a more conservative financial outcome.
